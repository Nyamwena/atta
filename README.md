*******************Project Details*******************

To develop an algorithm that calculates the shortest path between places after 
entering coordinates and shows the results on a map.

The algorithm should be our own or just enhance other algorithms e.g  djakistras .

Ideally, The system  should be used to plan and optimize routes when lecturers visit students on 
industrial attachment.

 INTERFACE
 Login page - as admin
            -as lecturer/user.

Admin
Enters student details including the location where the student is attached in the system.

 lecturer 
Enters the coordinates of the places in the system and the system  optimises the path on which student to visit first and  second etc
Basing on the shortest path the idea is to minimize time loss and cost whilst trying to locate 
the student manually. 
For example if the lecturer randomly enters the coordinates the system should pick the 
locations basing on shortest distance from the starting point till end.
